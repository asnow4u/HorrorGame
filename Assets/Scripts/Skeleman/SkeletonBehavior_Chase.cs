     * Chase: Sekelman is chasing the player
     * When the player is seen the skeleman will chase them. (Navmesh just following them)
     * If line of sight is broken, they will proceed to the last know location and look in the direction the player was looking at that time. 
     *      If they see the player again they will continue pursuit.
     *      If not, they will search the room for a bit, then will destroy on of the hidable locations. If only one remains the player is caught. If more than one exists the other hiding place will be destroyed
     *          We will need to determine that the direction vector points to a room
     * If the skeleman sees the player run into a hiding spot, they will be caught
